# 📦 Stream Plus

Smart sleep timer + intro or credits skipper for Plex Web. Minimal overlay, per-show rules, and a safe skipper that only clicks when it’s clearly an intro, recap, opening, credits, or outro. No accounts, no telemetry.

## 💡 Tips
- ⚠️ If Plex has **Automatically skip intros** enabled, Plex may still jump the playhead  
  👉 Disable that in Plex settings or leave our overlay lock on for shows where you do not want skips
- 🧼 Unknown skip buttons are ignored unless a matching rule is on

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
- 🕶️ **Timer not visible**
  - ✅ Ensure the extension is loaded and the Plex tab is active
  - 🔃 Refresh the Plex page
- ⏩ **Skips happen when rules are off**
  - 🔍 Check Plex setting **Automatically skip intros**
  - 🔒 Keep **overlay lock** on for that show
- 📌 **Rules don’t stick**
  - 🍪 Ensure the browser isn’t clearing site data on close
  - 🔐 Confirm storage is allowed in your profile
